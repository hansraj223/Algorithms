# Description:
# Given a string and 3 md5 hashes, find the anagram of given string which has
# given md5 hash.
# You are also given a wordlist file having around 0.1 million words, which
# might help you out.
# This is the wordlist:
# https://drive.google.com/file/d/13qjOPs4R6nHZcKyArRHHZZl62nQf8AON/view?usp=sharing
#
# Approach:
# - Filter words from wordlist file given, which can't be anagram.
# - Find the length of maximum string left in wordlist after filtering, it
# comes out to be 11.
# - We know length of input string is 18(20 - 2) so we find all triplets which
# sums to 18 and compute all combinations.
#
# Solution:
# printout stout yawls
# ty outlaws printouts
